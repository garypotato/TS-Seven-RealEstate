# REAL ESTATE Application

This application is under development, based on `TypeScript`, `React`, `Redux`, `Material UI`, `koa2` and `MySQL`. The property data is fetched from `Domain APIs`.
Please have a look: :point_right: https://main.d1rq67z79npovf.amplifyapp.com/
You can find the Domain API from: https://developer.domain.com.au/

## what I achieved

1. use `Typescript` to static Type-checking all the codes before running the app
2. `React` as the JS framework, `Material UI` as the UI framework
3. Data are stored in `Redux` or `localStorage` to increase user experience
4. consume RESTful APIs by `Axios`, follow the concept of `object-oriented programming` to `encapsuled` Axios and make it perfect fit in this app
5. use `Prettier` and `ESLint` to style codes
6. use `Husky` + `lint-staged` + `commitlint`, , make sure all the codes are standardized before every `git commit`
7. `koa2` + `MySQL` as the sever and database, which stores the `user information`
